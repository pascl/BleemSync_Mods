# Modding BleemSync 1.2 files

Modified files of BleemSync which permits:
* Launch CHD files (with "use RA from StockUI")
* Create launchers for folders

**THIS MOD IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE BLEEMSYNC DEVS. I MODIFIED SCRIPTS ON THE DRIVE MYSELF TO HAVE THIS RESULT.**

### Useful Tools:
* BleemSync 1.2 - use this mod as a base. Be sure you have run at least once your drive before modifying it [https://modmyclassic.com/bleemsync/]

### How to
#### Launch CHD files (from Stock UI)
* Replace the intercept file in bleemsync/etc/bleemsync/SUP/scripts/
* Enable the "use RA from stockUI" in BleemSync options (L1 in BootMenu)

#### Create launchers for folders
* Replace the launch.sh file in bleemsync/etc/bleemsync/SUP/launchers/folder_launch/
* Some pictures are in bleemsync/etc/bleemsync/SUP/launchers/folder_launch/images/ if you want more pictures.
* Launch the folder manager on your PSC and manage your folders.
* Exit the folder manager and it should create launchers for each folder. **IT CREATES AND OVERWRITES IF THEY ALREADY EXIST. IT CANT DELETE A LAUNCHER, YOU HAVE TO DO IT MANUALLY**

# Modding BleemSync 1.1 files

Modified files of BleemSync which permits:
* Rom launchers from stock UI
* Folders

**THIS MOD IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE BLEEMSYNC DEVS. I MODIFIED SCRIPTS ON THE DRIVE MYSELF TO HAVE THIS RESULT.**

### Useful Tools:
* BleemSync 1.1 - use this mod as a base. Be sure you have run at least one your drive before modifying it [https://modmyclassic.com/bleemsync/]
* pbPSCReAlpha (1.3+) - can generate multi DB files to split games in folders [https://github.com/pascl/pbPSCReAlpha]
* pbImgUtils - can resize pictures and add text easily creating several files at once [https://github.com/pascl/pbImgUtils]
* COMING SOON - pbPSCBSLauncherGenerator - auto-generate launchers scanning folders [https://github.com/pascl/pbPSCBSLauncherGenerator]
